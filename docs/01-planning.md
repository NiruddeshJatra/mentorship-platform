## Key Decisions & Tradeoffs

| Question                             | Decision                              | Why                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Separate mentors/mentees tables?     | ‚úÖ Yes                                 | Cleaner schema, easier for role-specific data                |
| Topics vs Session Types vs Expertise | ‚úÖ Unified via `mentor_expertise`      | Avoids redundant tables, allows pricing/duration flexibility |
| Timezone handling                    | üåç Asia/Dhaka by default              | Simplifies MVP, can be converted later                       |
| Booking confirmation                 | ‚úÖ Manual by mentor                    | Prevents double-booking conflicts                            |
| Recurring slots                      | ‚úÖ Supported via pattern field         | Needed for long-term mentoring                               |
| Double booking prevention            | ‚úÖ Via DB constraints & atomic updates | Ensures data integrity                                       |
